## What Happens Next?
Suggestions for enhancing DataCite’s services and the DataCite Metadata Schema will be logged and processed by DataCite’s Product and Adoption Teams. Community suggestions help these teams make decisions about features and enhancements to work on, so we appreciate all feedback!

Keep an eye on your discussion in the case that:
 - We need more information to better understand your suggestion. 
 - We identify that your suggestion is best handled by our Support and Adoption Teams.
